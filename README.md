# CornerGrocer

The Corner Grocer project was designed to analyze an input file of grocery items and generate frequency data to help identify buying trends. The program allows a user to view item counts, search for specific items, and display a text report or histogram representing the data. It also writes the histogram to a backup .dat file for persistence. The main problem it solves is taking raw inventory data and transforming it into something a store owner could use to quickly visualize which products are selling most frequently.

One area I feel I did particularly well in was ensuring input validation and error handling. By protecting against invalid menu inputs, unexpected file errors, and case sensitivity issues, I made the program more user-friendly and resilient. I focused on clean organization by separating functionality into multiple files (main.cpp, Inventory.h, and Inventory.cpp), which improved readability and maintainability. Where the code could be enhanced further is in efficiency and scalability. For example, introducing better file handling strategies for larger datasets or using more advanced data structures. These improvements would make the program more efficient and adaptable to real-world inventory systems.

The most challenging part of the project was writing the input validation logic, particularly around converting user input into usable values without crashing the program. I overcame this by using try/catch blocks, testing with invalid inputs, and refining my menu system so that only valid options are processed. Moving forward, Iâ€™m adding references like C++ documentation and peer-reviewed examples into my support network to continue building stronger coding habits. The skills I built here, such as modular programming, input validation, file I/O, and data visualization, are highly transferable to other projects. By clearly commenting my code, using clear function names, and organizing files by purpose, I made the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable for future improvements or collaboration.
